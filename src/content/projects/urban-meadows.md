## About the Project

The Urban Meadows Initiative transforms underutilized urban green spaces into thriving meadows that support local biodiversity, particularly pollinators like bees and butterflies. These meadows not only provide essential habitats but also serve as educational spaces for the community.

## Goals

- Convert 5+ hectares of urban green space into biodiverse meadows
- Increase pollinator populations by 30% in project areas
- Engage local communities in conservation efforts
- Provide educational programs for schools and residents

## Achievements

- Successfully converted 7.5 hectares of land
- Documented 25+ new pollinator species in project areas
- Engaged over 1,000 community volunteers
- Reduced maintenance costs by 40% compared to traditional lawns

## Future Plans

We plan to expand the initiative to more neighborhoods and develop a citizen science program to monitor biodiversity.
