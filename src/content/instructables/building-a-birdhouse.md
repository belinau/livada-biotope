## Introduction
Building a birdhouse is a rewarding project that benefits local wildlife. This simple design is perfect for small songbirds like chickadees, wrens, and sparrows.

## Step 1: Cut the Wood Pieces

Cut your wood into the following pieces:
- Front: 6" x 8" (with a 1 1/2" hole 1 1/2" from the top)
- Back: 6" x 14"
- Sides: 2 pieces at 4 1/2" x 8" (angled at 15Â° at the top)
- Bottom: 4 1/2" x 4 1/2"
- Roof: 6" x 8"

## Step 2: Drill the Entry Hole

Using a 1 1/2" hole saw, drill an entry hole in the front piece. The hole should be centered horizontally and placed 1 1/2" from the top. This size is perfect for small songbirds while keeping larger birds out.

## Step 3: Assemble the Box

1. Attach the sides to the front piece using wood glue and screws.
2. Attach the back piece to the sides.
3. Add the bottom piece, making sure it's secure but removable for cleaning.
4. Attach the roof with hinges or screws on one side so it can be opened for cleaning.

## Step 4: Finishing Touches

1. Sand all surfaces to prevent splinters.
2. Fill any screw holes with wood putty.
3. Paint or stain with non-toxic, exterior-grade finish.
4. Add ventilation holes near the top of the sides.
5. Add drainage holes in the bottom.

## Mounting Your Birdhouse

Mount the birdhouse on a pole or tree, 5-10 feet above the ground. Face the entrance hole away from prevailing winds and direct sunlight. Make sure it's in a location that's safe from predators.

## Maintenance

Clean the birdhouse annually in late winter before nesting season begins. Remove old nesting material and scrub with a solution of one part bleach to nine parts water. Rinse thoroughly and let dry before rehanging.
