## Our Mission

The Livada Biotope is conceived as a counter-space, a playground of encounters that supports different ways of relating to our kin in a decolonial manner. Under auspices of BOB Institute, we foster horizontality with other beings, plants, animals, fungi and microbiota, combining art, science, (post)humanities, ecofeminism, agriculture, somatics and other domains through transdisciplinary educational, experiential, social and political activities.

We are tackling the challenge of abandoning anthropocentric principles and immersing ourselves in the wetlands, to reactivate the inherent relational links between all the actors of the ecosystem. We want to empower the community to use the space according to ecofeminist biocentric notions where humans are part of the cross-species communal life on earth to the same extent and under the same conditions as other living beings. Humans are now custodians of the meadow, no longer masters or dominant extractive users of the environment.

## Our Team

Our team consists of dedicated individuals committed to fostering a more harmonious relationship with the natural world.
