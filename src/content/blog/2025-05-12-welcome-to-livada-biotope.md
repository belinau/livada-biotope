# Welcome to Livada Biotope

We are an eco-feminist initiative developing land-based practices and promoting sustainable living. Our mission is to develop sustainable land practices and educate about environmental awareness.

## Our Values

- **Sustainability**: We believe in practices that can be maintained over time without depleting natural resources or causing ecological damage.
- **Community**: We value the power of community and collective action in creating positive change.
- **Education**: We are committed to sharing knowledge and raising awareness about environmental issues.
- **Eco-feminism**: We recognize the connection between the exploitation of nature and the oppression of women, and work to address both.
