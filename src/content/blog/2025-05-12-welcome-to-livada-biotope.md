# Welcome to Livada Biotope

We are an eco-feminist initiative developing land-based practices and promoting sustainable living. Our mission is to develop sustainable land practices and educate about environmental awareness.

## Our Values

- **Sustainability**: We believe in practices that can be maintained over time without depleting environmental resources or causing ecological damage.
- **Community**: We value the power of community and collective action in creating positive change.
- **Education**: We are committed to sharing knowledge and raising awareness about environmental and social issues.
- **Ecofeminism**: We recognize the connection between the exploitation of environment and the oppression of women, foreigners and others and work to address it in all manifestations.
