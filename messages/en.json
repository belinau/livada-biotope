Through the BOB Institute, we work with art, science, and practical activities to create connections across different fields and ways of knowing.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe're interested in moving beyond human-centered thinking and learning from the environment around us. As temporary residents of this space, we're figuring out how to live alongside other species in ways that work for everyone.",
