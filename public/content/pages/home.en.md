The Livada Biotope is a refuge where we wholeheartedly dedicate ourselves to braiding relations with our more than human kin. As a special initiative within the BOB Institute, we operate from a foundation of ecofeminist practices, permaculture ethics, and a deep connection to the earth and our kin. 

We believe in the power of community and interspecies collaboration. Here, we are learning to live in reciprocity, where every interaction—from the smallest microbe in the soil to the tallest sedge in the marshy meadow—co-creates our shared, interwoven world. 

Therefore, we invite everyone, regardless of expression, positionality, or belief, to join us. We welcome all who are prepared to actively contribute to nurturing different ways of being and thinking—ways that arise from carefully listening to and being in contact with the beings with whom we share this space. Join us in co-creating a future that is not dried out, but teeming with life.
