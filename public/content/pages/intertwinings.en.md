In these intertwinings, our measurements allow us to listen to the whisper of the soil, which tells us about moisture, temperature and life beneath the surface. The data is refreshed every hour.

## Let's Not Dry Up the Future

The project focuses on the development of sustainable water management practices in the Livada Biotope. By combining radio technology and sensors, we have developed a system for monitoring environmental indicators, with the aim of strengthening our understanding of the dynamics of this fragile and crucial ecosystem. The main focus is on monitoring soil moisture levels, as summer brings drastic drying and the formation of large cracks in the ground, which intensifies erosion processes. We are therefore studying the impact of different cover crops on mitigating this phenomenon.

By involving the community in the planning of solutions and conservation efforts, we want to encourage deeper connections between people, the more than human inhabitants of the meadow and their local environment in the search for a true balance that takes into account the needs of all living beings, not just humans.

### Project objectives

* Monitoring real-time temperature and humidity in the soil and air.
* Studying the impact of different cover crops on soil moisture retention.
* Documenting and tracking changes in biodiversity.
* Developing sustainable water management practices in a specific context.
* Creating educational resources about wetlands and their biodiversity and practical solutions.
* Involving the local community, especially youth, in conservation efforts and more than human relationships.

### Current status

We have installed several sensors throughout the Livada Biotope to continuously monitor the state of the environment. Data is collected in real time and sent via a radio link to our archiving and display system.

We also carry out regular monitoring of species and inhabitants of the meadow. To date, we have documented numerous plants and animals, including those on the red list of endangered species, which urgently need the preservation of this very specific habitat for their survival.
