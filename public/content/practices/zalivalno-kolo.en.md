      Prepare the bicycle

      Take a simple indoor bicycle or an old bicycle frame. Keep one wheel with its tire in place, as this will become the source of motion. Secure the bicycle so it stands steady while pedaling.

      Build the transmission system

      Under the front wheel, fix a rotating attachment. The insides salvaged from an electric drill work well, as it can capture the motion of the tire and transfer it into rotational energy. Position it so that as the wheel spins, the energy is passed directly into the pump.

      Connect the water pump

      Attach a flow-through pump to the transmission. On one side of the pump, connect a hose leading to a water container or cistern where rainwater or gathered water is stored. On the other side, connect another hose that will carry the water forward.

      Mount the sprayer

      Guide the output hose up along the handlebars. Fix a simple sprayer or nozzle at the front, so that when you steer the handlebars, you also direct the stream of water. This way, you ride not across space but across the soil itself, watering by intention.

      Ride and water

      Pedal steadily. As the front wheel turns, the pump begins to draw water from the cistern and push it through the sprayer. By moving the handlebars, you decide where the water will fall—onto a patch of greens, over young seedlings, or across a thirsty bed of soil. Your energy flows into the land directly, without detours of electricity or fuel.

Care for the land begins with our own bodies. To water a garden with my own movement is not only an act of nurturing plants, but also of rebalancing the relationship between human energy and ecological cycles. Instead of relying on fossil fuels or industrial systems, we choose to pedal and to let our rhythm become the pulse that carries water from the earth back to the soil. This watering bicycle is a feminist gesture of repair—reclaiming technology as something intimate, embodied, and in service of life.

Below are the steps to create a watering bicycle, an interface between human and environment.
