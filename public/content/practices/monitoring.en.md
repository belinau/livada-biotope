## Making Observations
We invite you to become a citizen scientists support our biodiversity monitoring efforts by recording photos of plants and animals you encounter at the Livada Biotope. Please always make sure your observations contain clear photos with significant features shown, you can also add a set of photos for one observation when needed to show more details. You can either just make photos and submit them later or make photos and upload to iNaturalist app immediatelly. The process is very simple.

## iNaturalist Web and Applications

 You can submit your contributions with location metadata through iNaturalist app on your phone or via web browser. 

[iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org)

Please remember to mark the location as **the Livada Biotope,** or **LivadaLAB** so the observations will be connected with the site and automatically added to our collection project on iNaturalist. Because you will be posting via your own profile to iNaturalist, you control the copyright settings and other features of how this should be made available. We encourage cc licences that enable easier sharing. Observation gathered in our monitoring projects are also shown on our web application and in the memory game.

Our kin from the meadow than you in advance for helping them gain visibility.
