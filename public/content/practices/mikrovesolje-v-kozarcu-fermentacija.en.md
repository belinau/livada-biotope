description: "On the Livada meadow, we live in harmony with the rhythms of
  nature and explore the hidden processes that create life. We become
  co-creators of a living microcosmos: through the practice of fermentation – an
  ancient biochemical method of preserving food – we enhance its digestibility,
  increase its nutritional value, and open up a palette of more complex
  flavours. Through this process, fermented food is enriched with probiotic
  microorganisms that live everywhere: in the soil, on plants, and also within
  our bodies."

      We harvest fresh purslane and check to ensure we've gathered the correct plant. We separate the leaves from the stems. Into a glass jar, we can put just the leaves, stems chopped into smaller pieces, or a mixture of both.


      Meanwhile, we boil water. We pour it into a glass or ceramic container and dissolve salt in it to make a 2-3% brine. We let it cool.

  - caption: We chop the rest of the vegetables - something that contains sugars as well. We added carrots, garlic, different types of beets, radishes. We load the vegetables and purslane into a clean glass jar.  At our discretion, we can add other spices - we included ginger, black sesame, and Korean chili for a funkier flavor palette.

      We weight down the contents and cover with cooled brine, ensuring the vegetables are completely submerged in the liquid to avoid unwanted organisms, for example, mold.

      We close the jar (we can use a lid or a fermentation lid with a valve). We place it at room temperature (18–24°C).


      For the first few days, we may notice bubbles, slight foaming, and a characteristic smell – a sign that fermentation is working.


      Time: 7–14 days for a mild taste, possibly up to 3–4 weeks for a more intense result.

      After two or three days, we can start checking the taste and level of sourness of our ferment and decide whether we want to continue the fermentation or possibly stop it. When we reach the desired taste, we move the jar to the refrigerator or a cold storage - lower temperature slows down fermentation and extends shelf life.


      Fermented purslane can be useful for several months. :)
