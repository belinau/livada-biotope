description: "On the Livada meadow, we live in harmony with the rhythms of
  nature and explore the hidden processes that create life. We become
  co-creators of a living microcosmos: through the practice of fermentation – an
  ancient biochemical method of preserving food – we enhance its digestibility,
  increase its nutritional value, and open up a palette of more complex
  flavours. Through this process, fermented food is enriched with probiotic
  microorganisms that live everywhere: in the soil, on plants, and also within
  our bodies."
