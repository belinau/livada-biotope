    caption: "Use string or sticks to mark out a circle of the desired size. In the outlined circle, drive stakes every 30â€“40 cm (slightly angled outward)."

    caption: "Gently bend branches without breaking them to make them more flexible. Between stakes, insert flexible branches in an alternating front-back pattern, repeat the process until a low woven border is formed."

    caption: "Inside the border, first place a layer of larger branches and pieces of wood. Add finer branches that fill the larger gaps. Leaves, mown vegetation, and straw form an absorbent, biodegradable core."

    caption: "On top, add quality soil (mixed with compost if needed) and shape it into a slightly concave form so water won't run off over the edge."

    caption: "Cover the surface with mulch, you can immediately plant seedlings or chosen seeds in the round bed."

Wattle structures made from twigs can serve numerous purposes, including creating slightly raised or elevated garden beds. By utilizing pruned material this way, we can sustainably shape the garden layout and create organic, curved structures. The advantages of such beds include better moisture retention in the soil and improvement of soil composition quality due to the decomposition of organic material present in the bed.

The logic of wattle making is simple, the most important part is proper preparation of stakes, branches, and twigs.
